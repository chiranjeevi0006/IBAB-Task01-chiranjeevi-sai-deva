# Task 3 — Sequence Analysis & Matrix Operations

## Objective
This task focuses on applying biological sequence analysis concepts and basic matrix operations using Python.  
The objective is to strengthen understanding of RNA translation, DNA analysis, logical problem solving, and modular coding practices.


## Project Structure

task3/
- sequence_analysis.py   (DNA/RNA related problems)
- matrices.py            (Matrix related problems)
- README.md              (Documentation)



## Section A — Sequence Analysis (sequence_analysis.py)

1. split_into_codons()
- Splits an RNA sequence into codons (triplets).

2. translate_rna()
- Translates RNA codons into a protein sequence.
- Translation starts at AUG and stops at STOP codons.

3. detect_mutations()
- Detects mutations by comparing reference and sample DNA sequences.

4. find_orfs()
- Identifies Open Reading Frames (ORFs) in a DNA sequence.

5. most_frequent_codon()
- Finds the most frequent codon in an RNA sequence.

6. conserved_regions()
- Identifies conserved regions between two sequences.

## Section B — Matrix Operations (matrices.py)

1. is_symmetric(matrix)
- Checks whether a matrix is symmetric.

2. row_sum(matrix)
- Computes the sum of each row.

3. column_sum(matrix)
- Computes the sum of each column.

4. multiply_2x2(mat1, mat2)
- Multiplies two 2×2 matrices.

5. min_max_matrix(matrix)
- Finds the minimum and maximum elements in a matrix.

## Notes
- All tasks are implemented using functions.
- Global variables are avoided.
- Code follows modular and readable practices.
- Functions are not executed automatically.
